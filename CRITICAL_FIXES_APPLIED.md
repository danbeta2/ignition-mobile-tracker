## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

### Issue #1: "Available in Future Version" Messages (REJECTION RISK: HIGH)

**Problem**: Two user-visible messages stating "available in a future version" were found:
1. TrackerViewExpanded - Map View
2. StatsViewExpanded - Heatmap View

**Why This Is Critical**: 
- Apple App Store Review Guideline 2.1 (App Completeness) explicitly states apps must not contain placeholders or "coming soon" features
- These messages indicate incomplete functionality
- **HIGH PROBABILITY OF AUTOMATIC REJECTION**

**Fix Applied**:
‚úÖ Removed `.map` case from ViewMode enum (TrackerViewExpanded)
‚úÖ Commented out map icon and map view switch case
‚úÖ Removed entire `sparkMapView` function with "future version" message
‚úÖ Replaced heatmap placeholder with EmptyView()
‚úÖ **ZERO "future version" messages remain in codebase**

**Files Modified**:
- `Features/Tracker/TrackerViewExpanded.swift`
- `Features/Stats/StatsViewExpanded.swift`
