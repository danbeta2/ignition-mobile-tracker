# Ignition Mobile Tracker

A comprehensive iOS productivity tracking application built with SwiftUI and Core Data, designed to help users capture, organize, and gamify their personal growth journey through "Sparks" of inspiration, action, and achievement.

**Language**: English (fully localized)  
**Platform**: iOS 17.0+  
**Framework**: SwiftUI, Core Data  
**Status**: Production-ready (v1.0.0)

## Overview

Ignition Mobile Tracker transforms daily productivity into an engaging experience by combining task tracking with gaming elements. Users record "Sparks" (moments of insight, decision, energy, experimentation, or challenge), complete missions, collect cards, and progress through a leveling system.

## Core Features

### 1. **Spark System**
The heart of the app - a flexible system for capturing moments of action and insight.

- **Five Spark Categories:**
  - **Decision**: Recording important choices and their rationale
  - **Energy**: Capturing bursts of motivation or physical activity
  - **Idea**: Logging creative thoughts and innovations
  - **Experiment**: Tracking trials, tests, and learning experiences
  - **Challenge**: Documenting obstacles overcome

- **Intensity Levels**: Each spark can be rated from Low to Extreme, affecting point calculations
- **Rich Metadata**: Add notes, tags, and timestamps to each spark
- **Real-time Tracking**: Instant save to Core Data with immediate UI updates
- **Smart Search**: Filter by category, date range, intensity, or search text
- **Points System**: Earn points based on category and intensity (e.g., Energy spark at extreme intensity = more points than an Idea spark at low intensity)

## Technical Architecture

### Technologies
- **Language**: Swift 5
- **Framework**: SwiftUI (iOS 17.0+)
- **Persistence**: Core Data
- **Notifications**: UserNotifications framework
- **Animations**: SwiftUI animations, haptic feedback

### Core Data Entities
1. **CDSpark**: Stores individual sparks with category, intensity, notes, tags, and timestamps
2. **CDMission**: Manages mission state, progress, and metadata
3. **CDUserProfile**: Tracks user stats, streaks, and points
4. **CDTable**: Represents custom tracking tables
5. **CDEntry**: Individual table entries with flexible data structure
6. **CDSparkCard**: Card collection data (owned status, rarity, obtain date, duplicate count)

### Architecture Patterns
- **MVVM**: Separation of views and business logic
- **ObservableObject Managers**: Singletons for SparkManager, MissionManager, CardManager, LibraryManager, UserProfileManager
- **NotificationCenter**: Inter-manager communication for events (spark added, mission completed, card obtained)
- **PersistenceController**: Centralized Core Data operations (CRUD)
- **Core Data Extensions**: Convert between Core Data entities and SwiftUI models

### Key Managers
- **SparkManager**: CRUD for sparks, triggers card drops
- **MissionManager**: Mission initialization, progress tracking, auto-reset logic
- **CardManager**: Card collection, drop logic, rarity determination, achievement checks
- **LibraryManager**: Table and entry management
- **UserProfileManager**: Profile updates, point/streak calculations
- **AudioHapticsManager**: Sound effects and haptic feedback for user interactions
- **IgnitionNotificationManager**: Schedule and manage local notifications
- **PushNotificationService**: Handle remote notifications (future)

## User Interface

### Main Navigation (Bottom Tab Bar)
1. **Home**: Dashboard with quick stats, Ignition Core, and Spark Cards section
2. **Tracker**: All sparks with advanced search and filtering
3. **Library**: Custom tables for repeated tracking
4. **Missions**: All missions with filters and view modes
5. **Stats**: Analytics and charts

### Custom Header (All Views)
- App logo (or "IGNITION" text gradient)
- Pill-shaped buttons: "STATS" and "SETTINGS"
- Consistent across all tabs for unified navigation

### Home View Highlights
- **Ignition Core Card**: Level, points, fuel gauge (visual metaphor for progress)
- **Quick Actions**: Navigate to Tracker, Library, Missions, Stats (with background images)
- **Spark Cards Section**: 3 rarest cards, completion stats, "View Collection" button

### Theming & Aesthetics
- Inspired by modern dark-themed casino UIs
- Heavy use of fire/flame imagery
- Gradient buttons with glow effects
- Deep shadows and subtle borders on cards
- Bold, impactful typography (rounded system font, heavy weights)
- Iconography with rarity-specific colors (gray, blue, purple, gold)

## Data Flow

### Adding a Spark
1. User taps "Add Spark" in Tracker or Quick Action
2. Fills form (title, category, intensity, notes, tags)
3. On save:
   - Spark saved to Core Data via PersistenceController
   - SparkManager updates in-memory array
   - CardManager triggers card drop based on category
   - If card obtained, CardRevealView displays with animation
   - If duplicate, bonus points awarded and notification sent
   - UserProfileManager updates points, streak, category counters
   - MissionManager checks for progress updates (e.g., "Create 5 sparks today")
4. UI refreshes automatically via @Published properties

### Mission Reset & Tracking
1. App initializes 43 fixed missions on first launch (via `initializeFixedMissions()`)
   - 5 Daily, 10 Weekly, 28 Achievement (permanent)
2. Reset mechanism:
   - Checks on app foreground entry (battery-efficient)
   - At midnight: Daily missions reset progress to 0, status to available
   - On Monday: Weekly missions reset progress to 0, status to available
   - Achievement missions never reset
3. Progress tracking:
   - Spark-based missions: Auto-update via NotificationCenter observer
   - Card missions: Track via CardManager events
   - Points/Streak/Overload: Pull from UserProfile
   - Total spark count: Query from SparkManager
4. Mission completion:
   - Auto-complete when progress reaches target
   - Award reward points to user profile
   - Post `.missionCompleted` notification
   - Show global toast notification (appears after card reveal if applicable)
   - Play haptic feedback and sound effects

### Card Drop Logic
1. Spark created and saved
2. `CardManager.triggerCardDrop(for: category)` called
3. Rarity determined by weighted random roll (cumulative probability)
4. Eligible cards filtered by category and rarity
5. Random card selected from eligible pool
6. `PersistenceController.obtainSparkCard(cardId)` updates Core Data:
   - If new: `isOwned = true`, `obtainedAt = Date()`, `ownedCount = 1`
   - If duplicate: `ownedCount += 1`, return bonus points
7. CardRevealView presented with full-screen animation
8. User dismisses, returns to app flow
